## Usage/Examples

Using the tool is definitely easier than installing it, this section will guide you through the process of actually generating the mod.

1. Obtain images.
- These can be images you have gathered online or created yourself (Lucky you!)
- For the program to function, there's a requirement of 53 images that need to be populated in the images/ directory, this is because otherwise there will be duplicate images everywhere.
- If you're looking to just test the tool, I have a sample of 53 images you can use: [test-images.zip](https://github.com/N4GR/ZZZ-Box-Art-Generator/releases/download/v1/test-images.zip)
> [!NOTE]
> Ensure the images are appropriately proportioned; a square image isn't going to look nice being stretched to a rectangle!

4. To run the script, use the following command:
```
python .\main.py
```
5. Add your images to the UI using the + button, once all 53 images have been populated, the start button is displayed.
6. Click on the start button and enter in your mod name and the directory you want the mod to export to.
5. Let the script do it's thing, once it's complete you will see a green tick.
6. Navigate to the export folder you selected and you should see a folder with the name you given the tool, this folder should containg:
- Previews directory containing PNG previews.
- DDS files.
- Populated .ini file with hashes.

7. Move the generated folder into your mods directory of your model importer for ZZZ.
8. Launch your game and ensure the mod is functioning.
9. Pat yourself on the back!

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you aren't launching your newly generated mod alongside another mod that modifies the same area - they won't work together.
