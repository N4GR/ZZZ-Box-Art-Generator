If you already have python installed and understand how to install dependencies; you only need to download the [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows) library and you can skip these steps.

```
pip install -r "requirements.txt"

## Usage/Examples

Using the tool is definitely easier than installing it, this section will guide you through the process of actually generating the mod.

1. Obtain images.
- These can be images you have gathered online or created yourself (Lucky you!)
- For the program to function, there's a requirement of 53 images that need to be populated in the images/ directory, this is because otherwise there will be duplicate images everywhere.
- If you're looking to just test the tool, I have a sample of 53 images you can use: [test-images.zip](https://github.com/N4GR/ZZZ-Box-Art-Generator/releases/download/v1/test-images.zip)
> [!NOTE]
> Ensure the images are appropriately proportioned; a square image isn't going to look nice being stretched to a rectangle!

2. Move the images into the images/ directory within the tool.
3. Open the Terminal from within the main directory of the tool.
4. To run the script, use the following command (replace mod-name with the name of your mod):
```
python .\main.py --name "mod-name"
```
5. Let the script do it's thing, once it's complete the program will end, looking like this:

    - Note down any correct any errors shown to make the generation more seamless.

6. Navigate to the mods/ folder within the tool's directory and you should see a folder with the name you given the tool, this folder should containg:
- Previews directory containing PNG previews.
- DDS files.
- Populated .ini file with hashes.

7. Move the generated folder into your mods directory of your model importer for ZZZ.
8. Launch your game and ensure the mod is functioning.
9. Pat yourself on the back!

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you aren't launching your newly generated mod alongside another mod that modifies the same area - they won't work together.
